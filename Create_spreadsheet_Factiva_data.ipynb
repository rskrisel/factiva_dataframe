An ideal time to pack them are on rainy or snowy adventures. However, if you sweat a lot, they can trap inside moisture, too, which can lead to damp, stinky socks. So pair your boots with wool or synthetic socks, which are designed to wick moisture away from your feet. Some good boot options I've tested out recently are the Teva Grandview Gore-Tex hiking boot ($175) and the Muck Outscape Max boot ($130). The Grandview combines waterproof leather, quick-dry mesh and Gore-Tex. Gore-Tex is a waterproof yet breathable material; it's often used in gloves, boots and rain jackets. The Grandview feels very comfortable, thanks to its adjustable heel lock system, which relieves pressure off your toes when hiking downhill. The Outscape uses rubber and flexible neoprene to repel the elements. It also has a large collar opening, making it easy to slip the boots on and off.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Author_Name\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Anonymous\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"CombinedText\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Q: What should I bring on a cold campout? - Mark, Knoxville, Tennessee A: THINK LAYERS.
